# IPFLSTM: Enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks with LSTM and Informer for Efficient Long-Term Prediction of Dynamic Physical Fields

This repository contains the implementation and resources for **IPFLSTM**, a novel framework that combines LSTM networks and Informer architectures with physics-based constraints to predict dynamic physical fields efficiently and accurately.

## Overview

IPFLSTM addresses challenges in time-series prediction of complex dynamic systems. The framework:

1. Leverages physics-informed constraints to guide the learning process.
2. Utilizes LSTM for capturing long-term temporal dependencies.
3. Incorporates the Informer architecture for efficient sparse attention modeling.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Design**: Combines data-driven deep learning with physics-based constraints.
- **Robust Temporal Modeling**: Handles long-term dependencies with LSTM and Informer.
- **High Accuracy and Efficiency**: Outperforms traditional methods in dynamic field predictions.

## Use Cases

The framework can be applied to various dynamic physical systems, including:

- Evaluating the deformation of electromagnets.
- Monitoring the aging of critical components (e.g., rubber springs, bearings).
- Detecting anomalies like short circuits in electromagnetic systems.
- Predicting long-term behavior of physical fields for engineering applications.
